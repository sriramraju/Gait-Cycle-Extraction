# Gait-Cycle-Extraction
A MATLAB code to extract gait cycles using wavelet decomposition technique. The algorithm uses Daubechies wavelet to decompose the signal to 4 levels. The code extracts gait cycles with almost 99 % accuracy if the gait cycles are periodic for atleast 5~6 seconds. The code also derives features like energy and variance and tries to differentiate between various activities like running, jumping, etc.
The code tests the algorithm on a sample dataset.
The main code: pro_v2.m

If you have a dataset, please load it into the variable 'Data'.
